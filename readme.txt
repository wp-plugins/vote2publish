Wordpress MU Plugin: Adds a box in every post of every blog in the community. The post with a certains number of votes is republished into the "main blog"

== Description ==

Part of the RePublish set of tools for Wordpress MU.

Vote2Publish is a wpMU plugin wich allows you to define a "main blog", and then displays a vote box in every post of every other blog in the community.

When a post gets a certain number of votes it is automatically republished in the "main blog", preserving the original author and adding a note on the top of it with a link to where it was originally posted.

*Each blog owner can customize the vote box to match to his/her theme.. or even choose not to display it.

*Ajax powered. 
*Localization ready
*Comes with pt_BR translation

Note: Requires wp-xajax plugin.
